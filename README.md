# Mobile Chat Code Challenge

Create a chat application that allows people to send messages to each other. This is an open-ended challenge with endless solutions.

## Minimum requirements

* you must be able to view messages.
* you must be able to send a message.
* you must get realtime updates: if another client sends a message, you should see it without a refresh.
* you must be able to use it from a mobile device.

## Creative Spin

We're looking for developers who have a good product sense. Add something you think is missing from this chat experience. Bonus points for originality, but execution is paramount. Doing one of these well is much better than doing four of them poorly.

Some examples:

* photo support
* typing notifications
* likeable messages
* native app through cordova
* chrome/safari notifications
* embedded media (e.g. a youtube link turns into a youtube embed)
* multiple chat rooms
* group conversation

## Submitting

Once you're finished or bored, submit a PR with your solution. Include in this:

* how long it took
* what you would add if you had more time
* what you would clean up/refactor if you had more time

Have fun!
